Restrict Content Pro
====================

Restrict Content Pro is a commercial plugin available from [http:/pippinsplugins.com](http://pippinsplugins.com/restrict-content-pro-premium-content-plugin/). The plugin is hosted here on a public Github repository in order to better faciliate community contributions from developers and users alike. If you have a suggestion, a bug report, or a patch for an issue, feel free to submit it here. I do ask, however, that if you are using the plugin on a live site that you please purchase a valid license from the [website](http://pippinsplugins.com/restrict-content-pro-premium-content-plugin/). I cannot provide support to anyone that does not hold a valid license key.
